Fluorescence microscope images of CHO cells using five 
different labels (anti-giantin, Hoechst 33258 (DNA), 
anti-lamp2, anti-nop4, anti-tubulin).

These images were used in our image classification and 
typical image selection projects, and have been referenced 
in the following publications:

Recognition of Patterns Characteristic of Subcellular 
Structures in Fluorescence Microscopy Images. Cytometry 33:
